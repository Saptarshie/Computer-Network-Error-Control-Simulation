The Mahabharata is not just a story—it is a mirror. A mirror that reflects human flaws, karmic debts, and the relentless cycle of cause and effect.
It is not a tale of heroes and villains, but of choices and consequences, of intentions and the burdens they leave behind. And within this vast epic, some souls carried curses so heavy that even time could not erase their suffering.
But who was the most cursed of them all? This is not an easy question to answer, because every curse in the Mahabharata was not just a punishment—it was a lesson.
And if we listen closely, we might hear whispers of those lessons in our own lives.
